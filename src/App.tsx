							<h1>Certified James Hardie Siding Installation</h1>
							<p>We're certified James Hardie installers. That means that you'll not only have Hardie installed
							on the side of you house, but you'll have it installed right the first time and backed by industry leaders.</p>

							<Parallax img={Hunters.Images.hardie2}>
								Are you concerned that wooden or vinyl siding will break down in the Okanagan elements?
								James Hardie Siding could be the solution to your problem!
							</Parallax>

							<h3>Why Choose Hardie Board Siding?</h3>

							<Hunters.ListItem number={1} title="Fire Rated and Non-Combistible">
								James Hardie Siding is Fire Rated and Non Combustible making it a much safer option than
								traditional vinyl or wooden siding that will easily burn or melt if exposed to fire or
								an intense heat scenario
							</Hunters.ListItem>

							<Hunters.ListItem number={2} title="Insurance Premiums">
								Insurance Premiums can potentially be cheaper for homeowners that use Hardie Siding over
								traditional vinyl and wooden siding
							</Hunters.ListItem>

							<Hunters.ListItem number={3} title="Fantastic Warranties">
								Depending on the specific product you decide to use you will be entitled to anywhere
								from a 10 year to a lifetime warranty! Most James Hardie Siding products carry a 30 year
								warranty
							</Hunters.ListItem>

							<Hunters.ListItem number={4} title="Incredibly Durable And Protective">
								Hardie Siding is Incredibly durable and is 5 times thicker than vinyl siding. This means that not only will your siding last much longer it will also protect your home much better
							</Hunters.ListItem>

							<Hunters.ListItem number={5} title="Extreme Weather Resistance">
								James Hardie Siding is extremely weather resistant and was made to withstand winds up to 240 Kilometers an hour! That is 150 Miles an hour! Weather conditions that could easily damage vinyl siding such as hail can be easily handled by Hardie Board. Hardie Board is also highly resistant to warping, rotting, and cracking which are common issues with wooden siding.
							</Hunters.ListItem>

							<Hunters.ListItem number={6} title="Amazing Color">
								Hardie Siding is extremely flexible when it comes to color. It uses ColorPlus Technology finishes that are baked on and offer up to 30 percent improvement when it comes to fade resistance over other options. The colors are computer matched so it is as consistent as it gets. When it comes to wood and vinyl siding the color consistency and fade resistance simply do not match up to Hardie Board and when repairs are needed it is much harder to match the color perfectly
							</Hunters.ListItem>

							<Hunters.ListItem number={7} title="Looks And Performance">
								Hardie Siding provides the same beautiful wood grain finish as traditional wooden siding without the issues of wood and without the cheaper plastic look of vinyl
